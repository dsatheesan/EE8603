# Machine Learning Project - EE86 8603 Coursework

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project completed as part of the EE86 8603 coursework.The project is presented in a video, outlining the process in five main steps.

## Video Presentation

Watch the video presentation of the machine learning project on the [EE8603 - Machine Learning Project Presentation](https://www.loom.com/share/b9ed92175b2245a1a83fac95d1485790?sid=298253a6-0b1d-4e53-b5d8-8161c4dc4625).


## Steps

1. **Library and Data Introduction:**
   - Introduction to the required libraries: PyCaret, pandas, os, and others.
   - Highlighting the dataset used: KingRook versus KingPawn.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Utilization of PyCaret for exploratory data analysis.

3. **Model Implementation:**
   - Implementation of the machine learning model using the PyCaret library.

4. **Model Analysis:**
   - Examination of the model's pipeline for better understanding.
   - Analysis of the confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
   - Determination of feature importance for insights into model decision-making.

5. **Model Deployment:**
   - Deployment of the trained model on the Google Cloud Platform.

## Libraries Used
- PyCaret
- pandas
- os
- google cloud

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EE86_8603_ML_Project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd EE86_8603_ML_Project`
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to reproduce the analysis.
4. Ensure the required libraries are installed: `pip install pycaret pandas google-cloud`
